# Bilevel DEA-based column generation framework for finding inefficient parts of a network

_Joint work with Dr. Mark Karwan and Dr. Lei Sun_

Python implementation of a bilevel Data Envelopment Analysis-based framework for identifying the most inefficient subnetworks of arbitrary size. 

A detailed description and a mathematical formulation can with an example for a distribution network can be found in [MODEL.md](https://github.com/riabova/NetworkEfficiency/blob/main/MODEL.md)

- main.py: runs the model on sample data
- cg_model_relStop.py: model definition

Preparation of a sample dataset in progress.
